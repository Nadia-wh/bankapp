Assignments - Object Oriented Programming 
# Assignments - Object Oriented Programming

Assume you are implementing a Banking Application. Identify entities in the system. Create classes and methods for the various operations in a Bank.

* Use necessary access modifiers and encapsulation techniques to protect the data.
* Use constructors to initialize the objects.
* Use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes.
* Use abstract classes where necessary.
* Simulate some transactions in the application.
  
## Entities and Classes

## Deciding Entities

We first decide the entities that we are going to have in our diagram :

Bank
Account 
Customer
Transaction

## We then decide what attributes are associated with these entities:

Bank: Name
Account: Balance,holdername
Customer: Name
Transaction: Deposit Account, Withdrawal Account

## Deciding Relationships  

We then decide the relationships between the various entities:
A Bank Account is owned by a Customer.
A Bank has a Bank Account.
A Transaction is linked to the Bank Account. 
The relationship between Bank Account and Customer is many to one because a Customer can have many Bank Accounts.
The relationship between Bank and Bank Account is one too many as a Bank has many bank accounts. 
The Transaction to bank account relationship is many to one because multiple transitions can be linked to one bank account.


## Classes accordingly has been designed as 
BANK CLASS :
ACCOUNT CLASS :
TRANSACTION CLASS ;
MAIN CLASS (program.cs)

## MAIN FILE (program.cs)
